    "plantingDate": "Santa Maria: Oct 15 - Oct 30, Salinas/Watsonville: Oct 25 - Nov 15",
    "chill": "As with most day-neutrals, supplemental chill can improve quality. We recommend between 1-2 weeks of supplemental chill. Plants with too much chill will become larger and difficult to manage late in the season.",
    "fertility": "We recommend pre-plant fertilizer. Ranges vary, but between 500 and 600 lbs of 18-8-13 is sufficient in sandy soils. Heavier soils will require less fertilizer. A regular fertilizer regime during the fruiting season will depend on ranch specific requirements.",
    "other": "No special requirements. Follow standard sprays for powdery mildew, botrytis, and mites. Strong resistance to Fusarium. Moderately resistant to Macrophomina and Verticillium."
