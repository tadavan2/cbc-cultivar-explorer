    "chill": "Adelanto benefits from minimal to moderate chill requirements. We recommend 1-2 weeks of supplemental chill for optimal early season production. Excessive chill may delay the early harvest advantage.",
    "fertility": "Pre-plant fertilizer recommendations include 450-550 lbs of 18-8-13 in sandy soils. Lighter applications may be sufficient in heavier soils. Early season nitrogen management is critical for maximizing early yields.",
    "other": "Standard spray programs for powdery mildew, botrytis, and mites. Good resistance to Fusarium and moderate resistance to Verticillium. Monitor closely for early season pests due to rapid early growth."
